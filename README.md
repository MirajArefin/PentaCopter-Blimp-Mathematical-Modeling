# Experimental Insights into LQR-Controlled Penta Copter Blimps: Design, Construction, and Output Evaluation

The program defines the state space system of the pentacopter blimp and solves the gain matrix K for the LQR controller. Then, it calculates the blimp's behavior during maneuvers from one coordinate to another.
